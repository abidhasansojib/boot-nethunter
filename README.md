# boot-nethunter
It is an executable that boots Kali-Chroot (_one Installed with Nethunter_) in Termux. [Rooted Andriod]

**NOTE**: This is not the same as _Nethunter Rootless_.

# MOTIVE
If you have ever used Nethunter-Rooted, then you would have definitely come across Nethunter-terminal. Nethunter-terminal is one of the good interfaces but, it doesn't support that much customizability when compared to other interfaces such as Termux. If you ever took a fancy to start the **Rooted Kali chroot** in **termux** but faild. Then this is the right place.

# Setup Instructions
1. Git this repo in Termux HOME directory: `git clone https://github.com/name-is-cipher/boot-nethunter.git Nethunter`
2. Copy "boot-nethunter.sh" file from download git folder to HOME directory of Termux: `cp ./Nethunter/boot-nethunter.sh ./`
3. Make "boot-nethunter.sh" executable: `chmod +x boot-nethunter.sh`
5. ET Volia, setup is finshed !!!
6. Run the Executable to boot kali-Chroot: `./boot-nethunter.sh`
